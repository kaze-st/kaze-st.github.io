                <p>WeFund is a project that dedicates to community building and to provide people in need with donations
                    and bartering. Our main goal for this project is to ensure that for the people who have unwanted items,
                    they are able to barter or donate it away, so will not go to waste. Our main functionality of the project
                    is a donation pool. In this donation pool, group members will be able select their own wish item and
                    donate to the pool. Once the pool reaches the necessary funds for the item with the most priority, the
                    user who wished that item will be able to purchase it. There are two factors that determines which item
                    would go first in this priority queue. First, the most intuitive factor, the longer the item remains
                    in the queue, the more priority points it will get. Lastly, using priority votes, users can upvote an
                    item’s priority in case the it has to be purchased urgently. However, we do ensure that people do not
                    take advantage of the system by allowing users to block the item with the most priority the money in
                    the pool is frozen. With these features, our team wants to give the opportunity to the people who can
                    give to donate for the cause and the people who are in need to claim for the necessary help. Finally,
                    we included a group chat and a personal chat system that allows the members of a specific group to be
                    able to communicate within them in order to discuss about the donation pool. </p>

                <p>This is our love-letter to NASA for allowing our Earth-bound eyes to witness extraordinary astronomical
                    phenomena! A partner and I dabbled in UX and UI by improving NASA’s astronomical picture of the day website.
                    You can take a look here and see its beautiful 1998 CSS. The functionality of their website is robust,
                    but we felt that the styling was outdated and the navigation confusing. Thus, we utilized their API to
                    fetch the images and applied some “plastic surgery” to build a more interactive and better-looking website.

            <div class="text">
                <p>In my computer science lectures, I always encounter an interpreter who uses American Sign Language to
                    translate the professor’s lecture to a deaf student. Recently, I have seen many technologies that helps
                    the disabled such as Talkitt for the deaf and Be My Eyes for the blind. The promising intersection between
                    technology and disability is never far my mind. With this inspiration in mind, I wanted to create a similar
                    app that could help my people like my deaf classmate for DefHacks. The organizers for this hackathon
                    provided us with Microsoft latest Hololens, which for me it was the perfect technological tool for people
                    who cannot hear since they can use their sight. I came out with the idea to use the speech to text algorithm
                    provided by Hololens to display the captions of the speaker on the holograms, resembling the subtitles
                    of a movie. All the user has to do is to “click” a holographic button and that will start the program
                    to display the captions We are very proud of our final product, but we were still surprised and humbled
                    when it won Best Hack for Accessibility. </p>
